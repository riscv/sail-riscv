# Tests

* `riscv-tests` - a collection of very old pre-compiled ELFs from [the `riscv-tests` repo](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests). These are bare minimum tests; not very exhaustive at all.
* `first_party` - tests specifically designed for this Sail model. These tests are not designed to test all the features of RISC-V. Rather they are for testing new code that we add, and bug fixes.
