This directory contains some sample OS images and support files built
for the basic platform implemented by the model.  They were built with
toolchains that emitted illegal instructions, and require the model to
be patched to boot them:

```
patch -p1 < os-boot/os-boot-patch.diff
```

The device-tree for the 64-bit Sail model is described in `rv64-64mb.dts`.  This file
can be generated using:
```
./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_RV64 -dump-dts > os-boot/rv64-64mb.dts
```

The device-tree binary for OS boots can be compiled from that source file:
```
dtc < os-boot/rv64-64mb.dts > os-boot/rv64-64mb.dtb
```

The 64-bit Linux image can then be booted as:
```
./c_emulator/sail_riscv_sim -b os-boot/rv64-64mb.dtb -t /tmp/console.log os-boot/linux-rv64-64mb.bbl > >(gzip -c - > /tmp/exec-trace.log.gz) 2>&1
tail -f /tmp/console.log
```

The 64-bit FreeBSD image requires hardware PTE update support (`-d`):
```
./c_emulator/sail_riscv_sim -d -b os-boot/rv64-64mb.dtb -t /tmp/console.log os-boot/freebsd-rv64.bbl > >(gzip -c - > /tmp/exec-trace.log.gz) 2>&1
```

The 64-bit seL4 image runs its test-suite and requires more memory (`-z`):
```
dtc < os-boot/rv64-2gb.dts > os-boot/rv64-2gb.dtb
./c_emulator/sail_riscv_sim -z 2048 -b os-boot/rv64-2gb.dtb -t /tmp/console.log os-boot/sel4-rv64.bbl > >(gzip -c - > /tmp/exec-trace.log.gz) 2>&1
```

Note that the consistency of the `-z` argument and the contents of the
DTB have to be ensured manually for now.
