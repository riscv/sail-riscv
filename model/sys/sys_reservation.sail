// Reservation handling for LR/SC.
//
// The reservation state is maintained external to the model since the
// reservation behavior is platform-specific anyway and maintaining
// this state outside the model simplifies the concurrency analysis.
//
// These are externs are defined here in the system module since
// we currently perform reservation cancellation on privilege level
// transition.  Ideally, the platform should get more visibility into
// where cancellation can be performed.
