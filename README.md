RISCV Sail Model
================

This repository contains a formal specification of the RISC-V architecture, written in
[Sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/) ([repo](https://github.com/rems-project/sail)).   It has been adopted by the RISC-V Foundation.

The model specifies
assembly language formats of the instructions, the corresponding
encoders and decoders, and the instruction semantics.
The current status of its
coverage of the prose RISC-V specification is summarized
[here](doc/Status.md).
A [reading guide](doc/ReadingGuide.md) to the model is provided in the
[doc/](doc/) subdirectory, along with a guide on [how to
extend](doc/ExtendingGuide.md) the model. 


Latex definitions can be generated from the model that are suitable
for inclusion in reference documentation.  Drafts of the RISC-V
[unprivileged](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/blob/sail/release/riscv-spec-sail-draft.pdf)
and [privileged](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/blob/sail/release/riscv-privileged-sail-draft.pdf)
specifications that include the Sail formal definitions are available
in the sail branch of this [risc-v-isa-manual repository](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/tree/sail).
The process to perform this inclusion is explained [here](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/blob/sail/README.SAIL).

This is one of [several formal models](https://github.com/riscv/ISA_Formal_Spec_Public_Review/blob/master/comparison_table.md) that were compared within the 
[RISC-V ISA Formal Spec Public Review](https://github.com/riscv/ISA_Formal_Spec_Public_Review).


What is Sail?
-------------

[Sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/) ([repo](https://github.com/rems-project/sail)) is a language for describing the instruction-set architecture
(ISA) semantics of processors. Sail aims to provide a
engineer-friendly, vendor-pseudocode-like language for describing
instruction semantics. It is essentially a first-order imperative
language, but with lightweight dependent typing for numeric types and
bitvector lengths, which are automatically checked using Z3. 
<p>

Given a Sail definition, the tool will type-check it and generate
LaTeX snippets to use in documentation, executable emulators (in C and OCaml), theorem-prover definitions for
Isabelle, HOL4, and Coq, and definitions to integrate with our 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem">RMEM</a>
and
<a href="isla-axiomatic.cl.cam.ac.uk/">isla-axiomatic</a> tools for
concurrency semantics.  
<p>

<p>

Sail is being used for multiple ISA descriptions, including
essentially complete versions of the sequential behaviour of ARMv8-A
(automatically derived from the authoritative ARM-internal
specification, and released under a BSD Clear licence with ARM's
permission), RISC-V, MIPS, CHERI-RISC-V, and CHERI-MIPS; all these are complete
enough to boot various operating systems.  There are also Sail models
for smaller fragments of IBM POWER and x86.



Example instruction specifications
----------------------------------

These are verbatim excerpts from the model file containing the base instructions, [riscv_insts_base.sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_insts_base.sail), with a few comments added.

### ITYPE (or ADDI)
~~~~~
/* the assembly abstract syntax tree (AST) clause for the ITYPE instructions */

union clause ast = ITYPE : (bits(12), regbits, regbits, iop)

/* the encode/decode mapping between AST elements and 32-bit words */

mapping encdec_iop : iop <-> bits(3) = {
  RISCV_ADDI  <-> 0b000,
  RISCV_SLTI  <-> 0b010,
  RISCV_SLTIU <-> 0b011,
  RISCV_ANDI  <-> 0b111,
  RISCV_ORI   <-> 0b110,
  RISCV_XORI  <-> 0b100
}

mapping clause encdec = ITYPE(imm, rs1, rd, op) <-> imm @ rs1 @ encdec_iop(op) @ rd @ 0b0010011

/* the execution semantics for the ITYPE instructions */

function clause execute (ITYPE (imm, rs1, rd, op)) = {
  let rs1_val = X(rs1);
  let immext : xlenbits = EXTS(imm);
  let result : xlenbits = match op {
    RISCV_ADDI  => rs1_val + immext,
    RISCV_SLTI  => EXTZ(rs1_val <_s immext),
    RISCV_SLTIU => EXTZ(rs1_val <_u immext),
    RISCV_ANDI  => rs1_val & immext,
    RISCV_ORI   => rs1_val | immext,
    RISCV_XORI  => rs1_val ^ immext
  };
  X(rd) = result;
  true
}

/* the assembly/disassembly mapping between AST elements and strings */

mapping itype_mnemonic : iop <-> string = {
  RISCV_ADDI  <-> "addi",
  RISCV_SLTI  <-> "slti",
  RISCV_SLTIU <-> "sltiu",
  RISCV_XORI  <-> "xori",
  RISCV_ORI   <-> "ori",
  RISCV_ANDI  <-> "andi"
}

mapping clause assembly = ITYPE(imm, rs1, rd, op)
                      <-> itype_mnemonic(op) ^ spc() ^ reg_name(rd) ^ sep() ^ reg_name(rs1) ^ sep() ^ hex_bits_12(imm)
~~~~~~

### SRET 

~~~~~
union clause ast = SRET : unit

mapping clause encdec = SRET() <-> 0b0001000 @ 0b00010 @ 0b00000 @ 0b000 @ 0b00000 @ 0b1110011

function clause execute SRET() = {
  match cur_privilege {
    User       => handle_illegal(),
    Supervisor => if   mstatus.TSR() == true
                  then handle_illegal()
                  else nextPC = handle_exception(cur_privilege, CTL_SRET(), PC),
    Machine    => nextPC = handle_exception(cur_privilege, CTL_SRET(), PC)
  };
  false
}

mapping clause assembly = SRET() <-> "sret"
~~~~~


Sequential execution
----------

The model builds OCaml and C emulators that can execute RISC-V ELF
files, and both emulators provide platform support sufficient to boot
Linux, FreeBSD and seL4.  The OCaml emulator can generate its own
platform device-tree description, while the C emulator currently
requires a consistent description to be manually provided.  The C
emulator can be linked against the Spike emulator for execution with
per-instruction tandem-verification.

The C emulator, for the Linux boot, currently runs at approximately
300 KIPS on an Intel i7-7700 (when detailed per-instruction tracing
is disabled), and there are many opportunities for future optimisation
(our Sail MIPS model runs at approximately 1 MIPS). This enables us to
boot Linux in about 4 minutes, and FreeBSD in about 2 minutes. Memory
usage for the C emulator when booting Linux is approximately 140MB.

The files in the OCaml and C emulator directories implement ELF loading and the
platform devices, define the physical memory map, and use command-line
options to select implementation-specific ISA choices.


### Use for specification coverage measurement in testing

The Sail-generated C emulator can measure specification branch
coverage of any executed tests, displaying the results as per-file
tables and as html-annotated versions of the model source.


### Use as test oracle in tandem verification

For tandem verification of random instruction streams we support the
protocols used in [TestRIG](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/TestRIG) to
directly inject instructions into the C emulator and produce trace
information in RVFI format.  This has been used for cross testing
against spike and the [RVBS](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/RVBS)
specification written in Bluespec SystemVerilog.

The C emulator can also be directly linked to Spike, which provides
tandem-verification on ELF binaries (including OS boots).  This is
often useful in debugging OS boot issues in the model when the boot is
known working on Spike.  It is also useful to detect platform-specific
implementation choices in Spike that are not mandated by the ISA
specification.


Concurrent execution
--------------------

The ISA model is integrated with the operational model of the RISC-V
relaxed memory model, RVWMO (as described in an appendix of the [RISC-V
user-level specification](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/draft-20181227-c6741cb)), which is one of the reference models used
in the development of the RISC-V concurrency architecture; this is
part of our [RMEM](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem) tool.
It is also integrated with the RISC-V axiomatic concurrency model
 as part of our [isla-axiomatic](https://isla-axiomatic.cl.cam.ac.uk/) tool.

### Concurrent testing


As part of our concurrency architecture work, we have produced and
released a library of approximately 7000 [litmus
tests](https://github.com/litmus-tests/litmus-tests-riscv).  The
operational and axiomatic RISC-V concurrency models are in sync for
these tests, and they moreover agree with the corresponding ARM
architected behaviour for the tests in common.

We have also run these tests on RISC-V hardware, on a SiFive RISC-V
FU540 multicore proto board (Freedom Unleashed), kindly on loan from
Imperas. To date, we see only sequentially consistent behaviour there.



Use in test generation
----------------------

Our OCaml backend can produce QuickCheck-style random generators for
types in Sail specifications, which we have used to produce random
instructions sequences for testing.  The generation of individual
types can be overridden by the developer to, for example, remove
implementation-specific instructions or introduce register biasing.



Generating theorem-prover definitions
--------------------------------------

With Sail we aim to support the generation of idiomatic theorem prover
definitions across multiple tools. At present we support Isabelle,
HOL4 and Coq, and provide snapshots of the generated theorem prover
definitions.

Our theorem-prover translation can target multiple monads for
different purposes. The first is a state monad with nondeterminism and
exceptions, suitable for reasoning in a sequential setting, assuming
that effectful expressions are executed without interruptions and with
exclusive access to the state.

For reasoning about concurrency, where instructions execute
out-of-order, speculatively, and non-atomically, we provide a free
monad over an effect datatype of memory actions. This monad is also
used as part of our aforementioned concurrency support via the RMEM
tool.


The files under `handwritten_support` provide library definitions for
Coq, Isabelle and HOL4.

Getting started
---------------

### Building the model

Install [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/), either via opam
or by building Sail from source and setting `SAIL_DIR` in your
environment pointing to its top-level directory.  Then:

```
$ make
```
will build the 64-bit OCaml simulator in
`ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_RV64`, the C simulator in
`c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV64`, the Isabelle model in
`generated_definitions/isabelle/RV64/Riscv.thy`, the Coq model in
`generated_definitions/coq/RV64/riscv.v`, and the HOL4 model in
`generated_definitions/hol4/RV64/riscvScript.sml`.

One can build either the RV32 or the RV64 model by specifying
`ARCH=RV32` or `ARCH=RV64` on the `make` line, and using the matching
target suffix.  RV64 is built by default, but the RV32 model can be
built using:

```
$ ARCH=RV32 make
```

which creates the 32-bit OCaml simulator in
`ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_RV32`, and the C simulator in
`c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV32`, and the prover models in the
corresponding `RV32` subdirectories.

The Makefile targets `riscv_isa_build`, `riscv_coq_build`, and
`riscv_hol_build` invoke the respective prover to process the
definitions.  We have tested Isabelle 2018, Coq 8.8.1, and HOL4
Kananaskis-12.  When building these targets, please make sure the
corresponding prover libraries in the Sail directory
(`$SAIL_DIR/lib/$prover`) are up-to-date and built, e.g. by running
`make` in those directories.

### Executing test binaries

The C and OCaml simulators can be used to execute small test binaries.  The
OCaml simulator depends on the Device Tree Compiler package, which can be
installed in Ubuntu with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler
```

Then, you can run test binaries:


```
$ ./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_<arch>  <elf-file>
$ ./c_emulator/riscv_sim_<arch> <elf-file>
```

A suite of RV32 and RV64 test programs derived from the
[`riscv-tests`](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) test-suite is
included under [test/riscv-tests/](test/riscv-tests/).  The test-suite
can be run using `test/run_tests.sh`.

### Configuring platform options

Some information on additional configuration options for each
simulator is available from `./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_<arch>
-h` and `./c_emulator/riscv_sim_<arch> -h`.

Some useful options are: configuring whether misaligned accesses trap
(`--enable-misaligned` for C and `-enable-misaligned` for OCaml), and
whether page-table walks update PTE bits (`--enable-dirty-update` for C
and `-enable-dirty-update` for OCaml).

### Experimental integration with riscv-config

There is also (as yet unmerged) support for [integration with riscv-config](https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv/pull/43) to allow configuring the compiled model according to a riscv-config yaml specification.

### Booting OS images

For booting operating system images, see the information under the
[os-boot/](os-boot/) subdirectory.
